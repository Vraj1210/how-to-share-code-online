<section xml:id="motivation">
<title>Motivation</title>
<para>
This document aims to provide some general guidelines for
sharing source code which exhibits an undesirable behaviour, in
order for it to be reviewed and corrected on online forums.
</para>
</section>
<section xml:id="guidelines">
<title>Guidelines</title>
<section xml:id="short-self-contained-correct-example">
<title>Short, Self Contained, Correct, Example</title>
<para>
First of all, your code should exhibit the problem you are
having and should be a <emphasis role="bold">self-contained</emphasis>, and a
<emphasis role="bold">reproducing</emphasis> example. More guidelines can be found in
<link xlink:href="http://sscce.org/">“The Short, Self
Contained, Correct, Example” (= SSCCE)</link> page and in
<link xlink:href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example">Stack
Overflow’s “Minimal, Reproducible, Example” page</link> (whose
text is under
<link xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</link>).
</para>
<section xml:id="reducing-the-code">
<title>Reducing the code</title>
<para>
If the code is too large, please consider reducing it to a
more minimal example that still exhibits the problem (see
the
<link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method">bisection
method</link> ). Namely, you can try gradually removing
parts of the code while each time ascertaining that the
problem can still be reproduced until you have reached the
shortest possible code. Often, doing that will be enough to
find the culprit reason for the failure and to fix it.
</para>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="show-the-whole-code">
<title>Show the Whole Code</title>
<para>
Please don't share non-runnable pieces and fragments of your
code, see
<link xlink:href="http://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/show-us-the-whole-code/">“Show
Us The Whole Code”</link> .
</para>
</section>
<section xml:id="share-code---not-screenshots">
<title>Share code - not screenshots</title>
<para>
As a general rule, it is a better idea to share the code as
text, as that can be compiled and run.
</para>
<para>
When you do need to share
<link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot">screenshots</link>
of the code, try using a screenshot tool (such as the
Print-Screen button), rather than a camera (e.g: a
smartphone's).
</para>
</section>
<section xml:id="how-to-upload-the-code">
<title>How to upload the code</title>
<para>
If you are coding a web page, you can try sharing your code
using <link xlink:href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle</link> .
</para>
<para>
Otherwise, if your code is self-contained in one file, you can
use a paste site such as
<link xlink:href="http://ideone.com/">ideone</link> or
<link xlink:href="https://paste.debian.net/">paste.debian.net</link>. If
you are using an IRC chatroom, don't floodpaste the code to
the channel because this is slower and more annoying than
using a paste site and may get you kicked or devoiced out of
the channel.
</para>
<para>
If the code you are sharing is a reusable component, you can
use <link xlink:href="https://github.com/teambit/bit">Bit</link> to
isolate it and share it so that it can be installed or
imported in other projects.
</para>
<para>
Some other types of forums allow you to quote a single and
self-contained codebase using a notation such as
<link xlink:href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre">“pre”
tags</link>, or using indentation or triple-backquotes, so it may
be an option there depending on the forum’s policy.
</para>
<para>
If you have more than one file in the project, then you should
put it in a self-contained version control repository on a
code sharing site such as
<link xlink:href="http://github.com/">GitHub</link> ,
<link xlink:href="http://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</link> , or
<link xlink:href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</link> , so people can
easily clone or checkout it.
</para>

<section xml:id="use-a-continuous-integration-ci-service">
<title>Use a Continuous Integration (CI) Service</title>
<para>
If you have the time, and solving the issue is important for
you, you should set up a public
<link xlink:href="https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ_with_ToC__generated.md#what-do-continuous-integration-ci-services-such-as-travis-ci-jenkins-or-appveyor-provide">CI
service</link> with a build and test script, and which
reproduces the issue. This way, other people will have an
easier time reproducing it.
